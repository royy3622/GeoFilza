Iparf for iOS 12.1.3 to 12.2 (A9 -> A11)
by GeoSn0w (@FCE365)

This is pretty much Filza, the File Manager from Cydia. Escapes the Sandbox / Gets ROOT so that you can edit files with it and stuff.

* v1.1 - First release for iOS 12.1.3 / 12.2

It can write to /var/ and /tmp and it can read from anywhere. Enjoy
